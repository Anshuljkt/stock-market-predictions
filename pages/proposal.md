## Introduction/Background:
Stock markets are highly volatile in nature: millions of market participants are united in attempting to maximize returns through informed financial decisions. With the recent increase in availability of market data, various computational techniques are being studied for predicting stock movements. The seemingly unrelated information, however, makes it challenging for individuals to utilize the available data; hence, various machine learning approaches could significantly facilitate the process and allow better predictions of stock market trends.
 
## Problem Definition:
The first problem we consider is: how can different securities be clustered based on their stock data? We then consider: using past stock data and technical indicators, can we predict the price in the near future (i.e. 1-5 days)?
 
## Methods:
The features used in both analyses will be added to by preprocessing methods: utilizing daily stock market data to calculate various technical indicators. Several different indicators, models, and model parameters will be tested in this project to optimize results.

Daily stock market data from the last 20 years for a group of stocks will be preprocessed based on methods described in both Choudhry-Garg (2008), and Peachavanish (2016)â€™s papers to create features that will be used for clustering analysis. Technical features include Rate of Change, Momentum and moving averages. Clustering analysis will be performed via GMM, K-means and other relevant methods. 

In answering our second question, this project will analyze the effectiveness of several supervised learning methods. Recently, the majority of stock price direction prediction literature has focused on Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines (Ballings, 2015). We plan to use similar methods in our analysis.

## Potential results:
The clustering analysis will provide results that allow for the categorization of different stocks, and help inform the supervised learning portion of the project. This could allow our supervised models to be evaluated on an overall scale, and on a cluster by cluster basis.

The results from the supervised learning should show the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting stock prices at different time steps into the future. The objective is to identify the model, model parameters, and features that predict stock market prices most accurately by comparison.

## Discussion:
Stock selection will be important to ensure a wide representation of sectors and industries. It is possible that certain stocks across different market sectors move similarly. This research could be useful for finding a kind of elasticity among stocks, which is useful for investors wanting to diversify their portfolios and discovering new ways to hedge risk.
 
In the supervised learning part, a big challenge will be pre-processing the financial data to include technical indicators. We will have to make sure to include pertinent features that will accurately predict the stock price movement, where the main difficulty is to not overfit the model. For future plans, it would be interesting to expand the stock selection, proposed models, and timescale of data to give a more detailed look on the relationship between different stocks and industries.
